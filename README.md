**RobotProgram2017**: _Our competition program for 2017._

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for Team 5112's solution to the game FIRST Steamworks!
Feel free to look around in our completely open source robot program for some inspiration.
Please be aware that the above program is not complete.
This program is available for inspiration and support, not as a finished project to simply copy and paste into your robot.

This robot program was written using Eclipse Java Neon and the WPILib plugin.
These tools are very useful in order to take complete advantage over this resource.
